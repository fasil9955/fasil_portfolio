# Portfolio

This portfolio website is created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a powerful React framework. The project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-rendered and statically generated applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **Framer Motion**: A library for creating animations and transitions in React applications.
- **EmailJS**: A service for sending emails directly from the client-side without needing a server.

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
